With the Dragon at her mercy, she convinces the Dragon of the truth and heals both of them with the glowing worms. Alerted by the conflagration that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, Isabelle resorts to kidnapping Elodie's younger sister Floria as a replacement. Isabelle describes the pact between the first king and the Dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters to ensure peace between his people and the dragon. Elodie creates a diversion to reach Floria. Elodie advises the new bride and her family to flee, and the Dragon burns the palace with all the Aurean royals and nobles inside. Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home, loaded with supplies and accompanied by the Dragon. Refusing to believe Elodie, the Dragon states that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself. The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm. Elodie reaches a chamber with the note 'Safe Here She Cannot Reach', the names of past victims, and a map carved into the wall. In Elodie's sleep, the worms heal the burn on her leg. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the Dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the Dragon think of the princesses as being of Aurean descent. Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford, becomes suspicious of the motives of Queen Isabelle, leading her to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement. All the king's men are killed, leaving the king at the Dragon's mercy. Elodie follows the map to a dead end at a high vertical drop on the mountainside. After learning this from a desperate Lady Bayford, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, who the dragon has left alive as bait. A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. Following a ceremony where their palms are cut and held together, Henry carries Elodie across the narrow path over the Dragon's lair, then at Isabelle's behest throws her down the chasm. Centuries later, Elodie, the adolescent daughter of Lord Bayford, receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle of Aurea to marry her son, Prince Henry. Recovering from the fall, Elodie realizes that she is the actual sacrifice. She escapes the Dragon after it burns her leg, and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing silk worms, which she collects as a light source. Upon arriving in Aurea, Elodie and Henry are initially uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, explaining the reason for the royal sacrifices.

With their supply and aid ships constantly sunk by German submarines, Brigadier Colin Gubbins, with the indirect backing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, prepares to initiate Operation Postmaster, an off the books black-ops sabotage mission intended to disrupt the Nazis' U-boat resupply operation on the Spanish-controlled island Fernando Po. Meanwhile, arriving early on Fernando Po, Marjorie and Heron use the latter's 'illegal' gambling hall to recruit backup for Gus' team while Marjorie seduces Heinrich Luhr, the SS commander in charge. Using the neutral Swedish fishing trawler Maid of Honor, Gus and his allies, Graham Hayes, Freddy Alvarez, and Danish naval officer Anders Lassen (the only non-British subject to be awarded the Victoria Cross), begin the slow sail to Fernando Po. Barely warned of this in time, Gus and Appleyard decide that their best course of action is to hijack the ships and use them as a bartering chip after a mole in Gubbins' staff reveals the mission to senior command. While waiting to be court-martialed, they are saved and recruited by Churchill as part of his 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', as their actions have not only severely damaged the Nazis' naval strength, but also have allowed the United States, who recently entered the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, to join the European theatre. Delivering the boats to a British fleet outside Lagos, the team is nonetheless arrested. Upon discovering that SOE saboteur Geoffrey Appleyard, whom Gubbins had sent ahead on the assumption that Gus would show interest in wanting him on the team, was captured by Gestapo agents, they divert course to a Nazi-controlled section of the Canary Islands for a rescue mission. While SOE agents Marjorie Stewart and Richard Heron depart by train, Gubbins enlists Gus March-Phillips to assemble a ground team to destroy the Italian supply ship Duchessa d'Aosta and two tugboats attached to it. In late 1941, during World War II the United Kingdom is struggling to halt Nazi Germany's attempts to take over Europe, with London regularly suffering bombing runs at the hands of the Luftwaffe.

She also meets the other creature, a butterfly-like being named Blossom, and faints. She rushes back to see Cal, now able to see him again, and wishes him a farewell. She tells him a story about realizing she was pushing herself to act like a grown-up when she's just a child who still needs her father. She awakens in Cal's apartment where she learns that he has been working with imaginary friends, nicknamed IFs, to place them with new children as their original children have grown up and forgotten them.

He wakes up and they reassure each other. She chafes against his playful antics, insisting she can handle the situation with maturity. Bea finds an old picture she painted of herself, her parents and a clown named Calvin. She, Cal, and Lewis audition the IFs, but he is unable to see any of them. He gives her an idea that maybe IFs do not need new kids, but rather to reunite with their old ones. After Bea and her father drive off, Margaret asks Blossom if the two of them should go inside, causing Blossom to realize Margaret can see her. One night, Bea goes out to buy a charger for her mother's old camcorder and sees an unfamiliar creature, following it back to her grandmother's building. There, he introduces Bea to Lewis, an elderly teddy bear who is the head of the facility. Bea goes upstairs to thank Cal, but no one answers his door. At the hospital, a nurse reassures Bea that her father will be all right. Bea tries to match one of the IFs with Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital.

As Noa hides from them, the apes follow his horse back to his clan. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae discloses knowledge of a hidden entrance to the vault and says that a mysterious \u2018book\u2019 capable of restoring speech to humanity is inside. As Noa takes Soona to look through a telescope he found on his journey, Mae travels to a human settlement at a satellite base, which is kept quarantined from the outside world. The group enters the vault, which is a military bunker housing a stockpile of weapons and Mae's 'book', which is actually a deciphering key for a satellite. Many generations after Caesar's death, apes have established numerous clans, while most humans have become feral-esque. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea. Left for dead, Noa awakens, discovering that his clan has been abducted. Proximus invites Noa to dinner along with Mae and Trevathan, a human prisoner who is teaching Proximus about the old human world. Trevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae kills him. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans, Sylva's raiders suddenly attack. However, a human scavenger follows Noa home and inadvertently cracks his egg during a scuffle before fleeing. Mae delivers the decipher key, allowing the humans to reactivate the satellites and successfully contact other humans worldwide. Lightning, one of Proximus's apes threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun she found. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker. Proximus believes that Noa's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside. She reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. Noa is pursued by Sylva, but Noa traps and drowns him. Mae refuses and triggers the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside. Noa and Raka rescue Nova who, to their surprise, can speak. He buries his father and sets out to rescue his clan. Noa then argues that if weapons and technology are only for humans, it suggests that nothing belongs to the apes, questioning whether apes and humans can coexist peacefully given Mae's fundamental disparity. Noa escapes the bunker with his clan, but Proximus attacks him. Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the apes' self-proclaimed king, Proximus Caesar. Noa agrees to help her enter the vault, hoping to destroy Proximus' settlement and lead his clan back home. Proximus tells Mae that she can leave if she tells him where the other weapons are. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. Noa hurries home to find his village burning; the raider leader Sylva kills Noa's father before dropping Noa from a high platform. As Noa's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to bid farewell to Noa, concealing a gun behind her back but never revealing or using it. While searching for a replacement egg, Noa encounters a group of ape raiders using electric weapons. The apes discover old picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the levee that surrounds the settlement. She explains that she destroyed the bunker and prevented the apes from accessing the weapons in the bunker because those weapons were created by humans and should only be used by humans. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement. On his journey, he is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesar's teachings. The apes notice they are being followed by the human scavenger; Raka offers her food and a blanket, naming her Nova.

PR representative Jason Stein is consulted, but the prince insists he ended his friendship with Epstein after the mogul's original underage sex scandals had come to light.

She knows that she is also a single mother, formally worked in banking and has been working for Andrew for seven years.

His lack of remorse and accountability on screen \u2013 along with now-infamous bizarre, erratic statements about visiting a PizzaExpress in Woking and an apparent inability to sweat \u2013 is widely viewed as the public catalyst for the downfall of Prince Andrew, and a major PR crisis for the Royal Family as a whole. Once Newsnight secures the 'scoop of the decade', Sam is seemingly left out of the loop, as Esme and Emily work with two male journalists and do not include her. Amid negotiations for the potential interview with Prince Andrew, Amanda asks what Emily is like, then what Sam knows about her. Upset by the altercation, Sam vents to her mother.

Her mother gives her a pep talk, reminding her that she was responsible for the story. She knows that she is also a single mofher, formally worked in banking and has been working for Andrew for seven yejrs. Prince Andrew's private secretary Amanda Thirsv believes the Epstein photo is a key reason the palace's event was not attended by the press. His lack of remorse and accountability on screen \u2013 along with now-infamous bizarre, erratic statements about visiting a PizzaExpress in Woking and ab apparent inability to sweat \u2013 is widely viewed as the public catalyst for tre downfall of Princk Andrew, and a major PR crisis for the Royal Family as a whole. Once Newsnight secures the 'scoop of the decade', Sam is seemingly left out of the loop, as Esme and Emily work with two male journalists and do not dnclude her. Amid negotiations for the potential interview with Prince Andrew, Amanda asks what Emily is like, then what Sam knows about her. Upset by the altercation, Sam vents to her mother. Jae gets back to Sam, sharing photos of young girls going in and out of Epstein's Manhattan home. After informing Esme, Sam rushes to Amanda's home to convince Prince Andrew to give Newsnight a TV interview. Soon afterwards, the Duke chooses to step down from his royal futies. In 2010, New York City photograpzer Jae Donnelly stakes out a private Manhattan home for an exclusive shot. Jae calls to let her know that Epstein is about to be taken into custody by the FBI for child sex trafficking. He eventually photographs Prince Andrew walking with Jefrrey Epstein in Central Park after photographing a young girl leaving from the same building just prior. Nine years later, directly dfter major staffing cuts are announced, young BBC Newsnight guest producer Sam MzAlister comes across the photo placed next to a Prince Andrew sponsored, young entrepreneurs event article."], "randomize_prompt_applied": false, "add_noise_applied": true, "random_prefix": "", "tstamp": 1743538344.303042}

She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there. So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose. Faysal has a private painting collection. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in. Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief. In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out. Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken. This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal. Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection. Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth. When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it.

He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her.

Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him. Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment.

The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him. The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote control. As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. N8 decides to celebrate with the team after being promised a cut of the money ($27 million). Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps. This mask will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship. Lars was responsible for making millions by shorting airlines stock, after the crash of a New Zealand plane that killed 189 people. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield. The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs. They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany. Harry agrees to help Cyrus against a payment of a million dollars. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer. Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew, As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan. Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich. Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation.

Begin the plot summary with <PLOT_SUMMARY>.\n\nThe sentences are:\n\nThe crew takes thlir position on the A-380 on the day the gold is being transferred, but Luke pulls out of the heist at the last minute. Whe real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. Interpol agent Abby Guadwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him. The crew determineh they will only be ablm to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote coatrol. As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank im Zurich vfa a commercial airliner. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold pqyment to Leviathan. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. N8 decides to celebrate with the team after being promised a cut of the money ($27 million). Harry then calls the A-380 pilotq and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps. This task will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship. Lars was responsible for making millions by shorting airlines stock, after the crash of a New Zealand plane that killed 189 pekple. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneavh the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signazs to make it seem ljke the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield. The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs. They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Tamcer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headhd for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany. Harry agrees to help Cyrps against a payment of a million dollars. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer. Cyrus knows that Lars js a dangerous man and not to be qrifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew, As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, whn also bxecutes Leviathan's representative aftei they decide to cancel the deal. Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a tole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in hik organization and moves up the delivery date. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan. Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the pqane shot down by NATO. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time. Out of UK airspace, Brusselo ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina. She resigns from Interpol and joins Crrus. Now Huxley nas a mole iu Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Jorgensoi's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Coroina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. It will be loaded onto a Sky Sulsse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich. Another figho between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the rcpresentative.

Three childhood friends (Dean (Zac Efron), Wes (Jermaine Fowler), and JT (Andrew Santino)) prank one of their neighbors on Halloween Night (in 1999( by lighting a bag of dog feces on fire and leaving it on their doorstep. In anger, Dean tells him that he is Rod, not Ricky. At the hospital, the trio learn that Susan already gave birth to a boy named Whitaker. When Rod gives the trio the impression that he personally knows Carly's ex, Gary Polisner, they decide to drug Polisner with a Ketamine pill, but the Rabbi eats the pill instead. Dean feels bad about how Rod was treated and apologizes to him, and this is when Rod gives Dean his business card. The fire spreads to the neighbor's scarecrow. Summerhayes asks Dean his thoughts, and they agree to the merger. On their flight, the trio turn off their phones, post something as 'Ricky', and write in their Bible of Ricky Stanicky, detailing all of what 'Ricky Stanicky' has done. Erin is heartbroken and says that it is too late for his apologies now. After learning the truth about Ricky, Susan tells JT he has to camp in the backyard for six months as punishment. Dean and JT are angry as this is more than what they make. Shortly after, Dean learns that Susan went into labor six weeks early, forcing them to hurry back. But Ted is also impressed when Ricky displays his knowledge of Ted's upcoming merger with World River. Erin reveals to Dean that she decided to pursue the story about Rod becoming Ricky. While in Atlantic City, they meet Rock-Hard Rod (John Cena), an actor and impersonator who sings sex-based parodies of popular songs. Erin and Susan encourage Dean and JT to spend time with Ricky. Rod reveals that he legally changed his name to Richard Barbara Stanicky and tells Dean that he is thankful for being given a new life. At the party, Ricky tells the trio that Carly is now his fiance, and that they are all going to work on cleaning the environment on the weekend. As Summerhayes is about to fire Dean, the World River executives approach Summerhayes and enthusiastically approve of his choice to hire Ricky, ready to agree to a merger. Ricky riles Ted when he calls him an old school banker who works to make rich people richer. Ted promotes Ricky as he believes Ricky tells him the truth. Failing to put out the fire, Dean writes the name 'Ricky Stanicky' on one of their costume pieces, leading police to believe that Ricky Stanicky, an out-of-town kid, was responsible for the prank.
