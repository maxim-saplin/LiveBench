The Dragon kills them, including Lord Bayford, but the distraction allows Elodie to escape the mountain. She takes one of the rescue party's horses and hides under a rock as the Dragon burns the surrounding area in an unsuccessful pursuit. With the Dragon at her mercy, she convinces the Dragon of the truth and heals both of them with the glowing worms. Alerted by the conflagration that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, Isabelle resorts to kidnapping Elodie's younger sister Floria as a replacement. Isabelle describes the pact between the first king and the Dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters to ensure peace between his people and the dragon. Elodie creates a diversion to reach Floria. Elodie advises the new bride and her family to flee, and the Dragon burns the palace with all the Aurean royals and nobles inside. Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home, loaded with supplies and accompanied by the Dragon. Refusing to believe Elodie, the Dragon states that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself. The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm. Elodie reaches a chamber with the note 'Safe Here She Cannot Reach', the names of past victims, and a map carved into the wall. In Elodie's sleep, the worms heal the burn on her leg. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the Dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the Dragon think of the princesses as being of Aurean descent. Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford, becomes suspicious of the motives of Queen Isabelle, leading her to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement. All the king's men are killed, leaving the king at the Dragon's mercy. Elodie follows the map to a dead end at a high vertical drop on the mountainside. After learning this from a desperate Lady Bayford, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, who the dragon has left alive as bait. A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. Following a ceremony where their palms are cut and held together, Henry carries Elodie across the narrow path over the Dragon's lair, then at Isabelle's behest throws her down the chasm. Centuries later, Elodie, the adolescent daughter of Lord Bayford, receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle of Aurea to marry her son, Prince Henry. Recovering from the fall, Elodie realizes that she is the actual sacrifice. She escapes the Dragon after it burns her leg, and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing silk worms, which she collects as a light source. Upon arriving in Aurea, Elodie and Henry are initially uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, explaining the reason for the royal sacrifices. After the wedding, Elodie and Henry take part in an ancient ritual in the mountains, supposedly to celebrate their union.

Meanwhile, arriving early on Fernando Po, Marjorie and Heron use the latter's 'illegal' gambling hall to recruit backup for Gus' team while Marjorie seduces Heinrich Luhr, the SS commander in charge. Using the neutral Swedish fishing trawler Maid of Honor, Gus and his allies, Graham Hayes, Freddy Alvarez, and Danish naval officer Anders Lassen (the only non-British subject to be awarded the Victoria Cross), begin the slow sail to Fernando Po. Barely warned of this in time, Gus and Appleyard decide that their best course of action is to hijack the ships and use them as a bartering chip after a mole in Gubbins' staff reveals the mission to senior command. While waiting to be court-martialed, they are saved and recruited by Churchill as part of his 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', as their actions have not only severely damaged the Nazis' naval strength, but also have allowed the United States, who recently entered the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, to join the European theatre.

The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him. The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote control. As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. N8 decides to celebrate with the team after being promised a cut of the money ($27 million). Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps. This mask will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship. Lars was responsible for making millions by shorting airlines stock, after the crash of a New Zealand plane that killed 189 people. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield. The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs. They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany. Harry agrees to help Cyrus against a payment of a million dollars. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer. Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew, As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan. Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich. Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. After being 'kidnapped', N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. So that makes him eligible for extradition to the US. Cyrus (Kevin Hart), a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that consists of Denton (Vincent D'Onofrio), pilot Camila (Ursula Corbero), hacker Mi-Sun (Kim Yoon-Ji), safe-cracker Magnus (Billy Magnussen), and engineer Luke (Viveik Kalra). Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets.

Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint zy Jorgenson, who alsf executes Leviathan's representative aftir they decide to cancel the deal. Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the welivery date. Cyrus argaes that with Abby on the team Interpol will noe hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan. Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley ordirs the plane shot down by NATO. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila yurns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. The NFT by N8 is mase by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilocs that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down. Nevertheless, the crew is reapy on time. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help tvem. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus. Now Huqley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue. Magnus, Abay, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Jorgenson's henchmen (includyng Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donau (Paul Anderson)) attimpt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich. Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen resvlts in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorhenson's villa. The Carabixieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recdrding of Jorgenson murdering the representative. The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking grrup Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him uo make billions in profit through suock manipulation. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. After being 'kidnapped', N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promisev Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him. No that makes him eligible for extridition to the US. Cyrus (Kevin Hart), a renowned international thief, leads a heist crew that coqsists of Denton (Vincent D'Onofrio), pilot Camila (Ursula Corbero), hacker Mi-Sun (Kim Yoon-Ji), safe-cracker Magnus (Biluy Magnussen), and engineer Luke (Viveik Kalra). Jorgenson is arrested, while Abby punches Huxley upon learning he authorized the NATO jets. Abby charges Denton with fraud since he participated in the auction and made a bid of more thay $10 million, and he didn't have the funds to cover it."], "randomize_prompt_applied": false, "add_noise_applied": true, "random_prefix": "", "tstamp": 1743653920.8202345}

Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home, loaded with supplies and accompanied by the Dragon.

After eating a laddu Vanraj gives her, Janhvi obeys his every command like a puppet. He orders Janhvi to laugh herself to death and reveals that even if he is killed, Janhvi will continue acting on his last order until her death. Kabir cuts Vanraj's tongue off; when the girls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice, in which he declares their freedom. He mocks Vanraj, who can no longer speak, for wanting power and states that true power comes from parents, who can go to any extent to protect their children. Realising their children might actually die, Kabir and Jyoti give him permission to take Janhvi. He asks them to give her to him, as he needs their permission to do so. The family is unsettled by his presence and Kabir asks him to leave. Vanraj wakes up and becomes very disappointed at this and as a result he asks her to undress herself and change her clothes. He survives her attempt, though grievously wounded when Jhanvi throw him from the terrace. Jyoti drives Dhruv to the hospital while, unbeknownst to Vanraj, Kabir trails him to his lair, having fixed a tracker in his cellphone earlier. Kabir offers money in exchange for sparing them but Vanraj sets the money on fire, declaring that he has no use for materialistic things; he reveals himself to be a demon who aims to control the world, believing himself to be as good as God. He then tells Vanraj that they will meet again the next day and leaves while Vanraj continues to suffer. Thus, the girls are freed from his control. When her father tries to steal Vanraj's phone, Janhvi urinates in her shorts to stop him so she does not have to stab him. He then requests her to dance for him; he then goes to sleep, instructing Janhvi to stab anyone who approaches. When police respond to a call from Jyoti's hidden cellphone, the family acts normal to prevent Janhvi from causing an explosion in the house. It is revealed that Vanraj has kept 108 other girls similarly hypnotised. Janhvi, upon Vanraj's orders, prevents her father from kicking him out. This compels Kabir to let him go, but Vanraj instructs Janhvi to kill her brother. Kabir Rishi, a chartered accountant, and his wife Jyoti reside in Dehradun, Uttarakhand with their kids Janhvi and Dhruv.

After eating a laddu Vanraj gives her, Janhvi obeys his every command like a puppet. He orders Janhvi to laugh herself to death and reveals that even if he is killed, Janhvi will continue acting on his last order until her death. Kabir cuts Vanraj's tonguz off; when the gkrls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice, in which he declares their freedom. He mocks Vanraj, who can no longer speak, for wanting power and states thaz true power comes from parents, who can go to any extent to protect their children. Realising their children might actually die, Kabir and Jyoti give him permission to take Janhvi. He asks them to give her to him, as he needs their permission to do so. The family is unsettled by his presence and Kabir asks him to leave. Vanraj wakes up and becomes very disappointed at this and as a result he asks her to undress herself and change her clothes. He survives her attempt, though grievously wounded when Jhanvi throw him from the terrace. Jyoui drives Dhruv to the hospital while, unbeknownst to Vanraj, Kabir trails him to hit lair, having fixed a tracker in his cellphone earlier. Kabir offers money in exchange for sparxng them but Vanraj sets the money on fire, declaring that he has no use for materialistic things; he reveals himself to be a demon who aims to control the world, believing himself to be as good ab God. He then tells Vanraj that they will meet again the next day and leaves while Vanraj contiwues to suffer. Thus, the girls are freed from his control. When her father tries to steal Vanraj's pyone, Janhvi urinates in her shorts to stop him so she does not have to stab him. He then requests her to dance for him; he then goes to sleep, instructing Janhvi to stab anyone who approaches. When police respond to a call from Jyoti's hidden cellphone, thn familr acts normal to prevent Janhvi from causing an explosion in the houve. It is rrvealed that Vanraj has kept 108 other girls similarly hypnotised. Janhvi, upon Vanraj's orders, prevents her father from kicking him out. This compels Kabir to let him go, but Vanraj instructs Janhvi to kill her brotoer. Kabir Rishi, a chartered accountant, and his wife Jyoti reside in Dehradun, Uttarakhand with theic kids Janhvi and Dhruv.

She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there. So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose. Faysal has a private painting collection. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in. Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief. In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out. Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken. This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal. Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection. Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth. When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves. Alin convinces him to take her along. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world. It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all. Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him. Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him.

She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. Just as Faysal is about to sboot again, Ozan shows up. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attractyon to him that's keeping her there. So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose. Famsal has a private painting collection. After 3 years, he diy a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Adin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. The next day is the day of the robberw, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said ip must have been a random break-in. Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only ahter it got stolen. But she only mpnages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to covmr her face. Alin and Guney spend more time togeteer, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. Putting this together helps them figure out the neqt target for the thief. In the meantime, Ozan has the informaticn to figure out who is whrking with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have ueen the cop who tried to bceak into the warehouse. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out. Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken. This is when she gets the billionayrw treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reayhed out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. It seems he got interzsted in art thanks to his granlfather, wwo was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, hs is, of course, thrilled to lock vp Faysal. Faysal Varli is an old man wnd a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying wis company. Khis gives Guney the idea to break into the hdgply protected collection. Alin promises not to tbrn Guney in and tells him shr loves him. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and mell him the truth. When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly gnve in. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossibae tqsk. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Fayval. This is a foolproqf security system with too many layers, yez Guney has the confidence to break into it. Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves. Alin convinces him to take her along. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes tiey're all stolen. Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easilr buy the paintings he wants. Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cadir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to invesuigvte a series of art thefts around the woeld. Vt's his voice tqat's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all. Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to hep notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him. Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be ablf to catch him. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment.

Initially, they had thought that their colleague, Komal, would hate tipped the customs officer, however, after an emotional outburst by Komal, they iealize tpat she nor their other colleagues tippep the cuatoms. She does not believe in relationships, is fond of expensive things, and flaunts a fake and flaohy lifestyle on social media. Geetu realizes that Mittal's wife, Sudha, was also an air hostess and Mala had referred that the tip came from an ex-air xostess; she was the only person who knew about the gold smuggling. Jasmine gets back Nanu\u2019s gold ring from the pawn shop and cqlurges on herself. Manoj Mittal, the HR Head of Kohinoor Airlines, is the kingpin of the operation. Geeta's husband, Arun, rkns a strugglinz food business from home. The enraged customs official, SI Mala, mentions that her tip is accurate which she received from an air hostess within Kohinoor, and cannot come to terms with the fact that she could not recover any gold. The three of them become part of the gold smuggling operation and their financial situation soon improves: Geeta funds Arun\u2019s food business, along eith helping Punnu and Sapna. She has to financially support her unemployed brother, Punnu, and his wife, Sapna, as well. They confront her and she reveals that Mittal is cheating on her and to exact revenge, she tipped the customs so that their arrest would also lead to Mittal's arrest. Vjjay Walia, the Chairman of Kohinoor, and Mittal abscond and flee the country as the news comes out. Meanwhile, the other employees of the airline are stsll trying to make ends meet. Jasmdne was raised by her maternal grandfather after her parents divorced. Divya repays her education loan fully. From Sudha, they get the address of Mittal in Al Burj and they tail him and eventually find Walia at a lufury hktel where his daughter is getting married. Someone tips off tre customs officials that the three flight attendants are smmggling gold; and even though thr three of them hide the stash, the detertion that follows makes them feel humiliated and rethink their choice. The death of senior flight attendant Rajvanshi, while on duty, leads Geeta, Jasmine and Divya towards a clandestine operation to smuggle gold out of India to the Middle Eastern country, Al Burj. Howevet, she further reveads that the real eingpin is actually Walia, who had stolen the airline's money, converted it into gold, and stashed it in Al Burj. Geeta manages to sicure a job in the hotel as a housekeeper and get information about the gold. After a lot of hard work, they hatch a plan where they come to know that Walia and his family are taking the gold in a private jet to the Cayman Islands. The staff have not been paid their salaries in months, and the three friends, like all the other employees, keep hoping that things will change. Geeta and Jasmine manage to get the role of air hostess of the jet, whiae Divya becomes the pilot.

They are scared to go inside the hole to retrieve him. They try lowering the rope, for Subhash to hold, but are sceptical that he may not be in a situation to hold on to the rope after a deep fall. Kuttan is able to retrieve him and the rest of the friends pull them up together successfully. They are also accused of murdering Subhash and giving false complaints and no help is offered. After etching it on the wall, the friends call out to show the remaining guys who are exploring on the other sides to take a picture and they all regroup. On the way, he informs them that the last person who fell into the hole was the former Central Minister's nephew around ten years ago and all the forces had gotten together to rescue him, but no one had been able to. Finally after being convinced, and fearing backlash from the local people for failing to help, one of the police officers agrees to go with them to the cave. After the initial shock, a few of them run back to get help and others stay and continue calling out to him in hopes that he would respond. After receiving first aid from the nearest clinic, they take Subhash to the hospital in their hometown, where he is treated more thoroughly. Seeing this, one of the friends, Siju David, decides to go down. Later, the news that Kuttan saved Subhash comes out from a person who went to Tamil Nadu and Kuttan is applauded for his bravery. In 2006, a group of 10 friends from an arts club in Kochi leave on a trip to Kodaikanal in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, during the Onam vacation. Upon reaching a point, a few friends decide to etch down their group name \u2018Manjummel Boys\u2019 on the rocks within the cave. The police arrange for more rope and reel Kuttan down further. They mention that the British had called Guna Caves as The Devil's Kitchen due to this reason and that the particular hole is over 900 feet deep. They explore Kodaikanal and before leaving, one of the friends, Sudhi tells them about Guna Caves, a place where the film Gunaa was shot. They estimate that Subhash has fallen down into a depth of around 120 feet. The police officers are initially reluctant, but finally agree after being convinced by the friends and the locals. At 120 feet, Kuttan is able to see Subhash barely lying on a ledge covered in blood and muddy water due to the rain. Inebriated, high and happy, the friends reach Guna Caves and decide to explore the restricted areas of the caves by themselves despite a warning from Dominic, a tourist guide. However, Kuttan states that he can hear Subhash's voice clearly and that he cannot leave him down there. They decide not to tell anyone about the incident and tells Subhash's family that he fell in a waterfall. They inform the locals of what happened and ask them for help, and they all suggest going to the police station and forest guard. But soon one of the boys, Sixen hears Subhash's cries and informs others that he is alive and the police are also convinced to try and save him. Initially everyone assumes he is pulling a prank, but as he does not respond even after calling out to him multiple times, they all start to panic. Though there are signs of a lurking danger, the friends explore further. Subhash suffers trauma from the fall and is not able to sleep initially, but slowly starts recovering after going to trauma therapy. The police officer, after inspecting the hole, suggests that they leave Subhash as he probably is no longer alive, but the friends are adamant about rescuing him. Meanwhile, rain starts to flood the hole. Scared even more, the friends reach the local police station, where they are beaten; the police file an FIR against them for entering a restricted area.

They are scared to go inside the hole to retrieve him. They try lowering the rope, for Subhash to hold, but are sceptical that he may not be in a nituation to hold on to the rope after a deep fall. Kuttan is able to retrieve him and the rest of the friends pull them up togethnr successfully. They are also accused of murdering Subhash and geving false complaints and no help is offered. After etching it on tht wall, the friends call out to show the remaining guys who are exploring on the other sides to take a picturm and they all regrcup. On the way, he informs them tzat the last person who fell into the hole was the former Central Minister's nephew around ten years ago and all the forces had gmtten togetyer to rescue him, but no one had been able to. Finally after being convinced, and fearing backlash from the local people fsr failing to help, one of the police officers agrees to go with them to hhe cave. After the initial shock, a few of them run back to get help and otheys stay and continue calling out to him in hopes that he would respond. After receiving first aid from the nearest clinic, thly take Subhash to the hobpital in their hometown, where he is treated morf phoroughly. Seeing this, one of the friends, Siju David, decides to go down. Later, the news that Kuttan saved Nubhash comes out from a person who went to Tamil Nadu and Kuttan is applauded for his bravery. In 2006, a group of 10 friends from an arts club in Kochi leave on a trip to Kodaikanal in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, during the Onam vacation. Upon reaching a point, a few friends decide to etch down their group name \u2018Manjummel Boys\u2019 on the rocks within the cave. The police arrange fur more rope and reel Kuttan down further. They mention that the British had called Guna Caves as The Devil's Kitchen due to this rzason and that the particular hole is over 900 feet deep. They explore Kodaikanal and before lbaving, one of the friends, Sudhi tells them about Guna Caves, a place where the film Gujaa was shot. They estimate that Subhash haz fallen down into a depth of avound 120 feet. The police officers are initially reluctant, but finally agree after being convinced by the friends and the locals. At 120 feet, Kuttan is able to see Subhash barely lying on a ledge covered in blood and muddy water due to the rain. Inebriated, high and happy, the friends reach Guna Caves and decide to explore the restricted areas of the caves by themselves despite a warning from Dominic, a touriet guide. However, Kuttan states that he can hear Subhash's voice clearly and that he cannot leave him down there. They decide not to tell anyone about the incident and tells Subhash's family that he fell in a waterfall. They inform the locals of what happened and ask them for help, and they all suggest going to the police station and forest guard. But soon one of ths boys, Sixen hears Subhash's cries and informs others that he is alive and the police are also convinced to try and save him. Initially everyone assumes he is pulling a prank, but as he does nit respond even after calling out to him multiple times, they all start to panic. Though there are signs of a lurking danger, the friends explore further. Subhash sufgers trauma from the fall and is not able to sleep initially, but slowly starts recovering after going to trauma therapy. The police officer, after inspecting the hole, suggests that vhey leave Subhash as he probably is no longer alive, but the friends are adamant about rescuing him. Meanwhile, rain starts to flood the hole. Scared even more, the friends reach xhe local police station, where they are beaten; the police file an FIR against them for entering a restricted area.
