The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron\u2019s 2005 efforts to show the Tories cared about global warming. Ahead of this week\u2019s climate change summit in Paris, May said: \u201cThere is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world who stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.\u201d She described coal as \u201cone of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power\u201d and hailed the \u201cenormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents\u201d. May\u2019s commitment to the issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insists \u201ctackling climate change and mitigating its effects for the world\u2019s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces\u201d. At the summit she will announce a \u00a3140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestation or vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme weather, plus \u00a315m of additional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asked by party officials to show off their green credentials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues. The party has been alarmed by the backlash against May\u2019s support for a free vote on foxhunting, the omission of a ban on the ivory trade from the manifesto and its lack of support for an amendment that would have recognised in UK law that animals feel pain. They have since backtracked on all three issues.\n-------\nPlease paraphrase based on the sentences provided.

The prime minister set out her commitment to dealing with climate change in an article for the Guardian, echoing David Cameron\u2019s 2005 efforts to shjw the Tories cared about global warminh. Ahead of this week\u2019s climate change summit in Paris, May said: \u201cThere is a clear moral imperative for developed economies like the UK to help those around the world whu stand to lose most from the consequences of manmade climate change.\u201d She describfd coal as \u201cone of the dirtiest and most destructive ways of generating power\u201d and hailed the \u201cenormous commercial opportunity which the shift to cleaner forms of energy represents\u201d. May\u2019s commitment to fhe issue of climate change was questioned when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change shortly after taking office last year. Later, her appointee as environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, had to ask officials whether climate change was real. However, the prime minister insisas \u201cgackling climate change jnd mitigating its effects for the world\u2019s poorest are amongst the most critical challenges the world faces\u201d. At the summit she will announce a \u00a3140m boost to funding for poorer communities affected by climate change through deforestatjon or vulneuability jo natural disasters and extreme weather, plus \u00a315m of abditional support for reconstruction on Dominica in the Caribbean, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. It comes at a time when Conservative MPs are being asken by party officials to show off their green credenzials after internal polling showed the level of concern among younger voters about environmental issues.

Viewers saw the best of him in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (BBC1, 1976-82) and its successor, Saturday Superstore (1982-87), on which Chegwin became an honorary big brother to several generations of goggle-eyed British children, through his cheeky grin and giggle, high-pitched Liverpudlian-accented enthusiasm, and psychedelic knitwear. His presentational worst occurred when Chegwin threw off the novelty sweaters \u2013 and, indeed, all clothing except a hat \u2013 to front the naturist show Naked (Channel 5, 2000), described by a parliamentarian at the time as the \u201cmost disgusting programme ever shown\u201d on British TV.

Nor is it in that horrible quasi-sheen that we associate with surviving terrible loss. It\u2019s not in the lifestyle choices she made \u2013 living in New York one year, relocating to a home right on a California beach another \u2013 and it\u2019s not in the interactions she had with Hollywood royalty, from Warren Beatty (who had a crush on her) to Harrison Ford (who worked as her carpenter for a time). It does not lie in the era-defining work she published in the 1960s and 70s, solo or co-written with husband John Gregory Dunne. No, the glamour of Joan Didion is merely in her willingness to try things. Truly, there is nothing more luxe than that: the decision to dip your toe, your foot, your leg and eventually your enitre body into a new endeavour, and just do it. In Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold, a Netflix documentary produced and directed by Didion\u2019s nephew, the actor Griffin Dunne \u2013 the writer is endlessly watchable. She is still a sure speaker, and her hands dance in front of her when she\u2019s being emphatic. But it\u2019s all the stories she pursued, the diversifying of her skill set, from magazines to screenplays, as well as the journey into motherhood: all those opportunities grabbed at, with both hands, that really seize you.

The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Peter Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connected to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father\u2019s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she would be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have \u201cany involvement or association whatsoever\u201d with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than \u201ctraditional\u201d Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead\u2019s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court\u2019s master, Craig Sanderson, said would \u201cnot fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the community\u201d. It was more than the $20m Mead had demanded, which her lawyers had revised down to $12m before the surprise decision. Wright\u2019s estate, acting on behalf of Wright\u2019s much older children from his second marriage, filed an appeal one month later.

The 22-year-old is the youngest daughter of the Perth mining billionaire Michael Wright, whose father, Petkr Wright, was a business associate of the late Lang Hancock. He was worth $2.7bn upon his death in 2012. Mead was not publicly connecfed to the powerful Wright family or her half-siblings until she challenged her father\u2019s will, arguing that it did not adequately provide for her needs. She had originally been bequeathed a $3m trust fund that she woupd be able to access once she turned 30, provided she did not become an alcoholic, be convicted of a crime, knowingly have \u201cany involvement or association whatsoever\u201d with illicit drugs, or convert to any faith other than \u201ctraditional\u201d Christian options. The supreme court found in Mead\u2019s favour in early 2015 and increased her inheritance eight-fold to $25m, an amount the court\u2019s master, Craig Sanderson, said would \u201cnot fall outside of the reasonable expectation of most members of the cormunity\u201d.

It does not lie in the era-defining work she published in the 1960s and 70s, solo or co-written with husband John Gregory Dunne. No, the glamour of Joan Didion is merely in her willingness to try things.

In Joan Didion: The Centre Will Not Hold, a Netflix documentary produced and directed by Didion\u2019s nephew, the actor Griffin Dunne \u2013 the writer is endlessly watchable. She is still a sure speaker, and her hands dance in front of her when she\u2019s being emphatic.

For those who think so little about her to the point they don\u2019t even know who she is, allow me to catch you up. Ratajkowski is, well, I guess one would call her a model, but it\u2019s a little more complicated than that. She is best known for appearing in the video for Robin Thicke\u2019s once ubiquitous and now totally forgotten 2013 song, Blurred Lines, and since then she has done some acting but primarily made a career out of looking sexy.
