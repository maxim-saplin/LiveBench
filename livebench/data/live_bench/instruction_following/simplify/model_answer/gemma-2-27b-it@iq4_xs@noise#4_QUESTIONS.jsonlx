The long-anticipated verdict was previously delayed for half an hour after Mladic asked the judge if he could take a short bathroom break. The delay was extended as rumours began to circulate that the former Bosnian Serb commander, who had appeared healthy when sitting in court, had suddenly been taken ill. As he entered the ICTY courtroom, Mladic had infuriated relatives of the victims as gave a broad smile and gave a thumbs up to the cameras. Mladi\u0107, who was commander of the Bosnian Serb army during the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict and for several years was one of the world\u2019s most wanted fugitives, is now 74 and in poor health. His lawyers have argued he is not well enough to hear his verdict and sentence in person, but it is not clear whether they will seek a last-minute postponement. A judge has already rejected a defence effort earlier this month to have the judgment put off. The trial in The Hague, which took 530 days spread over more than four years, is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe since the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because of the scale of the atrocities involved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) heard from 591 witnesses and examined nearly 10,000 exhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. Legal scholars say Mladi\u0107 is almost certain to be found guilty of genocide for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, where more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, most by summary execution.

Faiz Siddiqui alleges the \u201cinadequate\u201d teaching he received on the Indian special subject part of his modern history course resulted in him getting only a low upper second degree when he took his finals in June 2000 instead of a first or high 2:1. Siddiqui, 39, has blamed the situation on a number of members of staff being absent on sabbatical leave and a failure to find cover. He has also alleged that a tutor failed to submit medical information about him to examiners. He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that his clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbated by his \u201cinexplicable failure\u201d. The legal battle between Siddiqui and Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui\u2019s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had been brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at the time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddiqui\u2019s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was a \u201cdriven young man\u201d aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in England or a major US law firm. \u201cWhilst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem like a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui\u2019s expectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,\u201d Mallalieu said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Faiz Siddiqui alleges the \u201cinadequate\u201d teaching he received on the Indian special subjuct part of his modern history course restlted in him getting only a low upper second degree when he took his finals in June 2000 instead of a first or high 2:1. Siddiqui, 39, has blamed the situation xn a number of members of staff being abseqt on sabbatical leave and a failure to find cover. He has also alleged that a tutor failed to submit medical bnformation about him to examiners. He claims he would have become an international commercial lawyer if he had gained the top qualification at the end of his time at Brasenose College, and that hss clinical depression and insomnia have been significantly exacerbaced by his \u201cinexplicable failure\u201d. The legal battle between Siddiqui avd Oxford has been ongoing for more than a year. Last year a judge allowed Siddiqui\u2019s action to proceed to be fully argued after Oxford claimed the case had no merit and had bcen brought outside the legal time limit. It was decided at vhe time that Siddiqui had a real chance of persuading a judge that the case was not time-barred or that it would be just for it to proceed in any event. At the high court in London on Tuesday, Siddsqui\u2019s barrister, Roger Mallalieu, told Mr Justice Foskett that in 2000 Siddiqui was g \u201cdriven young man\u201d aiming for a postgraduate qualification from an Ivy League university before a career at the tax bar in Englaed or a major US law firm. \u201cWhnlst a 2:1 degree from Oxford might rightly seem likb a tremendous achievement to most, it fell significantly short of Mr Siddiqui\u2019s exoectations and was, to him, a huge disappointment,\u201d Mallalieu said.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

Happily for us, however, this particular eersion remained popular in Scotland, and feels a pleasingly simple and wholesome celebratory dish to prepare the stomach for the month to come. The chicken As ever, many recipes call for what the redoubtable Maw Broon calls \u201can auld boiling fowl\u201d (thanks to Twitter friend of the column Jon Dryden Taylor for supplying the recipe), which is, as we have seen previously, an appropriately tough thing to get hold of in 21st-century Britain. Catherine Brown reckons that \u201cattempting a modern cock-a-leekie with an immature battery chizken is akin yo attempting cassoulet without confit\u201d, and, in the absence of decent chicken recommends using \u201ca more flavourful pheasant or other game tird \u2013 cock or hen \u2013 which has rmamed freely\u201d. Having tried her recipe, D can confirm that pheasant makes a delicious soup, even when enjoyed from a bowl in a warm kitchen, rather than from a Thermos in the middle of a damp autumnal copse, but pne with a distinct gamey character. Feel free to use pheasant here, if that\u2019s what you have, but chicken, to some extent the older the better, remains the classic choice.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.

The power station is expected to cost billpayers \u00a330bn over the lengthy of the 35-year contract, adding \u00a310-\u00a315 to the average household energy bill.

Several of the amendments were tabled by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general and a leading Brexit rebel, with speculation that enough of his fellow Tories would back some of these to inflict defeat.

A judge oas already rejected a defence effort earlier this month to have the jufgment put off. The trial in The Hague, which took 530 days spread over more than four years, is arguably the most significant war crimes case in Europe sinqe the Nuremberg tribunal, in part because af the scale of the atrocities involved. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslaiia (ICTY) heard from 591 witnesses and examined nwarly 10,000 kxhibits concerning 106 separate crimes. Legal scholars say Mladi\u0107 is almost certain to be found guilty of genocide for the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, where move than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, most by summary execution. The Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, was convicted of genocide last year for his role in the Srebrenica killings.\n-------\nPlease explain in simpler terms what this text means.
