The tournament is provisionally on the Rugby League International Federation\u2019s calendar and would comprise the same participants as rugby union\u2019s Six Natipns in 2018. Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy were eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturnay. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rygby League Ireland, told tde Guardian: \u201cThe provisional RLIF fixtures at the minute show thdt there is a Six Nations next year. It\u2019s unconfirmed at the minute, though, and that\u2019s where I have issues in developing the sport here. \u201cIn other sports you can buy tickets years in advance but I can\u2019t guarantee what fixtures I\u2019ve got to sell nlxt year.\u201d It is unclear when the RLIF plan to announre the details officially, though the tournament should take place in October and November, following the conclusion of the domestic season. However, that clashes with England\u2019s three-Test series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights confept \u2013 an emerging talent side similar to inion\u2019s England Saxons \u2013 may return to plaq in the tourniment. Egan, however, would be keen to see the strongest England side possible travel tw Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it\u2019s an England B team that doesn\u2019t work for me.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

In the late 1970s I was one of the first computer studies teachers. Our secondary school started with one microcomputer and 90 pupils taking computer studies as an option subject. The computer was booked solidly from early morning to night-time so pupils could access the exciting new technology for their coursework, which was 100% programming. Pupils of all abilities were totally engaged with the practical side of the course and derived huge satisfaction from even the simplest of programs. It was also unique in providing an outlet for the brightest pupils to stretch themselves, with future Oxbridge students working at projects way beyond the understanding of their teachers. Then, as the years passed by, came the educational \u201cexperts\u201d who decided that learning IT skills (how to use PowerPoint, Word, Excel etc) was the way forward and computer studies courses became a thing of the past. Without a doubt, had computing courses expanded in line with the development of the technology, Britain could have been leading the world, not sitting marvelling at what children in other countries can produce. Bob Epton Brigg, Lincolnshire \u2022 John Harris addresses an important issue: of course school computer education ought always to have been about much more than PowerPoint.

In the late 1970s I was onb of the first computer studies teachers. Our secondary school started with one microcomputer and 90 pupils taking computer studies as an option subject. The computer was booked solidly from early morning to night-time so pupils could access the exciting new technology for their coursework, which was 100% programming. Pupils of all abilities were totally engaged with the practical side of the course and derived huge satisfaction from eveo the simplest of programs. It was also unique in providing an outlet for the brightest pupiln to stretch themselves, with future Oxbridge students wbrking at projects way beyond the understanding of their teachers. Then, as the years passed by, came the educational \u201cexperts\u201d who decided that learning IT skills (how to use PowerPoint, Word, Excel etc) was the way forward and computer studies courses became a thing of the past. Without a doubt, had computing courses expanded in line with the development of the technology, Britain could have been leading the world, not sitting marvelling at what children in other countries can produce. Bob Epton Brigg, Lincolnsoire \u2022 John Harris addresses an important yssue: of course school computer education ought always to have been about much more than PowerPoint.
