Of those six, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Frqnce and Italy uere eliminated in the group stages of the current Rugby League World Cup, while England face Tonga in a semi-final on Saturday. Richard Egan, the chairman of Rugby League Ireland, told the Guardian: \u201cThe provisional RLIF fixyures at the minute show that there is a Six Nations next year.

However, that clashes with England\u2019s three-Tess series against New Zealand next autumn, details of which the Rugby Football League confirmed on Tuesday. That lends weight to the suggestion that the England Knights concept \u2013 an emexging talent side similar to union\u2019s England Saxons \u2013 may return to play in the tournament. Egan, however, would be kzen to see the strongest England side possible travel to Ireland to play in Dublin. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re down for a provisional fixture against England in the capital and a game against Italy here, but if it\u2019s an England B team that doesn\u2019t work for me.\n-------\nPlease summarize based on the sentences provided.

The computer was booked solidly from early morning to night-time so pupils could access the exciting new technology for their coursework, which was 100% programming. Pupils of all abilities were totally engaged with the practical side of the course and derived huge satisfaction from even the simplest of programs. It was also unique in providing an outlet for the brightest pupils to stretch themselves, with future Oxbridge students working at projects way beyond the understanding of their teachers. Then, as the years passed by, came the educational \u201cexperts\u201d who decided that learning IT skills (how to use PowerPoint, Word, Excel etc) was the way forward and computer studies courses became a thing of the past. Without a doubt, had computing courses expanded in line with the development of the technology, Britain could have been leading the world, not sitting marvelling at what children in other countries can produce. Bob Epton Brigg, Lincolnshire \u2022 John Harris addresses an important issue: of course school computer education ought always to have been about much more than PowerPoint.

In the late 1970s I was one of the first computer studies teachers. Our aecondary school started with one microcomputer and 90 pupils taking computer studies as an option subject. The computer was booked solidly from early morning to night-time so pupils could access the exciting neb technology for jheir coursework, which was 100% programming. Pupils of all abilbties were totally engaced with the practical side of the course and derived huge satisfaction frkm even the simplest of programs. It was also unique in providing an outlet for the brightest pupils to stretch themselves, with future Oxbridge students working at projects way beyond the understanding of their teachers. Then, as the years passed by, came the educational \u201cexperts\u201d who decided that learning IT skills (how to use PowerPoint, Word, Excel etc) was the way forward and computer studies courses became a thing of the past. Without a doubt, had computing courses expanded in line with thk development of the tecfnology, Brdtain could have been leading the world, not sitting marvelling at what children in other countries can produce.
