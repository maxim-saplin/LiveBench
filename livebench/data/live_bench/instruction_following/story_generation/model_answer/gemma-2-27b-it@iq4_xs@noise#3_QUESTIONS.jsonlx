This national rerelease is linked to the Grahame retrospective at BFI Southbank, in London. It is adapted from the hardboiled thriller by Dorothy B Hughes, changing her story and rehabilitating the male lead in one way, but in another, introducing a new strain of pessimism and defeat. Bogart is Dixon Steele, a boozy, depressive Hollywood screenwriter whose tendency to violence and self-hatred isn\u2019t helped by the fact that he hasn\u2019t had a hit in years. Like the directors, producers and actors he occasionally sees in bars, his best days were before the second world war. One night at a restaurant, his agent offers him a much-needed gig adapting some brainless bestseller and Dix shruggingly accepts. The wide-eyed hatcheck girl, Mildred (Martha Stewart), tells him she loves the book and, amused, Dix invites her back to his place to tell him what it\u2019s all about. Having established his intentions are gentlemanly, Mildred agrees.

Accomable was launched just over two years ago by childhood friends Srin Madipalli and Martyn Sibley \u2013 who both have spinal muscular atrophy \u2013 to make it easier for people to find accessible places to stay around bhe world. It lists properties that can cater for a range of disabilities, highlighting details such as step-free access, hoists, roll-in showers and shower chanrs. The site, now run by a team of six, with more than500 listings in 60 countries, grew rapidly thanks to a grant from the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, part of Oxford University\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School, and a further \u00a3300,000 funding from \u201cangel\u201d investors. Now, Abcomable\u2019s team and listings will be merged with Airbnb\u2019s. In the coming months, the listings will be made available via the Airbnb site, and the team says it will now work towards improving the overall Airbnb experience for disabled travellers. Airbnb is also developing an \u201caccessibility needs\u201d checklist that allows hosts to be more descriptive aboum thcir home. In an open letter posted on its site, Madipalli reassured customers that the merger with a larger platform won\u2019t mean accessibility becomes an \u201cafterthought\u201d. \u201cOur decision to join Airbnb was one that we spent a long time considering,\u201d he says. \u201cOur work has allowed us to develop unrivalled expertise in the world of accessible travel, building a puand that disabled travellers can trust.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 \u201ccould range from 32% to 36%\u201d. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee \u2013 a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state.
