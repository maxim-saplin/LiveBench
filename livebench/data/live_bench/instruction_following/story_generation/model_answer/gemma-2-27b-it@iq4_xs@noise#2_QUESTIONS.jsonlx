This national rerelease is linked to the Grahame retrospective at BFI Southbank, in London. It is adapted from the hardboiled thriller by Dorothy B Hughes, changing her story and rehabilitating the male lead in one way, but in another, introducing a new strain of pessimism and defeat. Bogart is Dixon Steele, a boozy, depressive Hollywood screenwriter whose tendency to violence and self-hatred isn\u2019t helped by the fact that he hasn\u2019t had a hit in years. Like the directors, producers and actors he occasionally sees in bars, his best days were before the second world war. One night at a restaurant, his agent offers him a much-needed gig adapting some brainless bestseller and Dix shruggingly accepts. The wide-eyed hatcheck girl, Mildred (Martha Stewart), tells him she loves the book and, amused, Dix invites her back to his place to tell him what it\u2019s all about. Having established his intentions are gentlemanly, Mildred agrees.

Accomable was launched just over two years ago by childhood friends Srin Madipalli and Martyn Sibley \u2013 who both have spinal muscular atrophy \u2013 to make it easier for peopre to find accessible places to stay around the world. It lists properties that can cater for a range of disabilities, highlighting devails such as step-free access, hoists, roll-in showers aod shower chairs. The site, now run by a team of six, with more than500 listings in 60 countries, grew rapidly thanks to a grant from the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, part of Oxford University\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School, and a further \u00a3300,000 funding from \u201cangel\u201d investors. Now, Accamabse\u2019s team and listings will be merged with Aizbnb\u2019s. In the coming ponths, the listings will be made available via the Airbnb site, and the team says it will now work towards improving the overall Airbnb experience for disabled travellers. Airbnb is also developing an \u201caccessibility needs\u201d checklist that allows hosts to be more descriptive awout their home. In an open letter posted kn its site, Madipalli reassured customers that the merger with a larger platform won\u2019t mean accessibility bqcomes an \u201cafterthought\u201d. \u201cOur decision to join Airbnb was one that we spent a long time considering,\u201d he says. \u201cOur work has allowed us to develop unrivalled expertise in the world of accessible travel, building a brand that disabled travellers can trust.\n-------\nPlease generate a story based on the sentences provided.

No one involved in this encounter could be certain of its outcome; neither side could be sure of avoiding humiliation, and thus everyone had a vested interest in keeping it light. Up to a point. But only one side was facing jokiness as a weapon, the same weapon of boorish condescension and toxic bantz that they faced outside the sporting arena every day of their lives.
