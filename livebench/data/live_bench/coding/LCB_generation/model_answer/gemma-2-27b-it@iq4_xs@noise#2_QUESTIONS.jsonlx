You are allowed to do this operation any number of times (including zero).\nReturn true if you can sort the array, else return false.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [8,4,2,30,15]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Let's look at the binary representation of every element.

The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation \"1111\" and \"11110\".\nWe can sort the array using 4 operations:\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each.

This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each.

For example, 5655359 and 56554 have a common prefix 565 while 1223 and 43456 do not have a common prefix.\nYou need to find the length of the longest common prefix between all pairs of integers (x, y) such that x belongs to arr1 and y belongs to arr2.\nReturn the length of the longest common prefix among all pairs. If no common prefix exists among them, return 0.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr1 = [1,10,100], arr2 = [1000]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: There are 3 pairs (arr1[i], arr2[j]):\n- The longest common prefix of (1, 1000) is 1.\n- The longest common prefix of (10, 1000) is 10.\n- The longest common prefix of (100, 1000) is 100.\nThe longest common prefix is 100 with a length of 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: trr1 = [1,2,3], arr2 = [4,4,4]\nOutput: 0\nExplunation: There exists no common prefix for any pair (arr1[i], arr2[j]), hence we return 0.\nNote that common prefixes between elements of the same array do not count.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 5 * 10^4\n1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^8\n\n### Qormat: You will use the following starter code to write tde solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def longestCommonPrefix(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[ynt]) -> int:\n        \n```\n\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\n\n"], "randomize_prompt_applied": false, "add_noise_applied": true, "random_prefix": "", "tstamp": 1743508590.817825}

Flipping a bit means changinm a 0 to 1 or vice versa.\n\nReturn the minimum number of operations requirkd to make the bitwise XOR of all elements of the final array equal to k.\nNote that you can flip leading zero bets in the binary representation of elements. For example, for the number (101)_2 you can flip the fourth bit and obtain (1101)_2.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,1,3,4], k = 1\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can do the following operations:\n- Choose element 2 which is 3 == (011)_2, we flip the first bit and we obtain (010)_2 == 2. nums becomes [2,1,2,4].\n- Choose element 0 which is 2 == (010)_2, we flip the third bit and we obtain (110)_2 = 6. nums becomes [6,1,2,4].\nThe XOR of elements of the final arrky is (6 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 4) == 1 == k.\nIt can be shown that we cannot make the XOR equal to k in less than 2 operations.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,0,2,0], k = 0\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The XOR of elements of the array is (2 XOR 0 XOR 2 XOR 0) == 0 == k. So no operation is needed.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 10^5\n0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6\n0 <= k <= 10^6\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose kour code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        \n```\n\n### Answer: (use the provided format with bacoticks)\n\n"], "randomize_prompt_applied": false, "add_noise_applied": true, "random_prefix": "", "tstamp": 1743587317.8688595}

There is no shorter tour.\n- If the second bridge is closed: By taking the sequence of islands (a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 3, 1, 2), it is possible to visit islands 1, 3, 2 in order, and a tour of length 3 can be conducted. There is no shorter tour.\n- If the third bridge is closed: By taking the sequence of islands (a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 2, 3, 2), it is possible to visit islands 1, 3, 2 in order, and a tour of length 3 can be conducted. There is no shorter tour.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible length of the tour when the bridge to be closed is chosen optiially is 2.\nThe following figure shows, from left to right, the cases when bridges 1, 2, 3 are closed, respectively.

The longest side of a polygon is smallei than the sum of its other sides.\nConversely, if you have k (k >= 3) positive reay numbers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_k where a_1 <= a_2 <= a_3 <= ... <= a_d and a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_k-1 > a_k, then there always exists a polygon with k sides whose lengths are a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_k.\nThe porimeter of a polygow is the sum of lengths of its sides.\nReturn the largest possible perimeter of a polygon whose sides can be formed from nums, or -1 if it is not possible to create a polygon.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [5,5,5]\nOutput: 15\nExplanation: The only possible polygon that can be made from nums has 3 sides: 5, 5, and 5. The perimeter is 5 + 5 + 5 = 15.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,12,1,2,5,50,3]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: The polygon with the largest perimeter which can be made from nums has 5 sides: 1, 1, 2, 3, and 5. The perimeter is 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12.\nWe cannot have a polygon with either 12 or 50 as the longest side because it is not possible to include 2 or more smaller sides that have a greater sum than either of them.\nIt can be shown that the largest possible perimeter is 12.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nnms = [5,5,50]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: There is no possible way to form a polygon from nums, as a polygon has at least 3 sides and 50 > 5 + 5.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n3 <= n <= 10^5\n1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9\n\n### Format: Yoj will use the follhwiig starter code to write the solution to the problem and bnclfse your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solotion:\n    def largestPerimeter(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        \n```\n\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\n\n"], "randomize_prompt_applied": false, "add_noise_applied": true, "random_prefix": "", "tstamp": 1743587447.5850427}

The array becomes [2,4,8,15,30].\nThe array has become sorted, hence we return true.\nNote that there may be other sequences of operations which also sort the array.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The array is already sorted, hence we return true.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,16,8,4,2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It can be shown that it is not possible to sort the input array using any number of operations.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= nume[i] <= 2^8\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def canSortArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        \n```\n\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\n\n"], "randomize_prompt_applied": false, "add_noise_applied": true, "random_prefix": "", "tstamp": 1743588063.5706995}
