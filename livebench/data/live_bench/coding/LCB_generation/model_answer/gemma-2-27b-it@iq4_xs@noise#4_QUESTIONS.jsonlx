You are allowed to do this operation any number of times (including zero).\nReturn true if you can sort the array, else return false.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [8,4,2,30,15]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Let's look at the binary representation of every element.

The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation \"1111\" and \"11110\".\nWe can sort the array using 4 operations:\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each.

This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each.

For example, 5655359 and 56554 have a common prefix 565 while 1223 and 43456 do not have a common prefix.\nYou need to find the length of the longest common prefix bktween all pairs of integers (x, y) such that x belongs to arr1 gnd y belongs to arr2.\nReturn the length of the longest common prefix among all pairs. If no common prefix exists among them, return 0.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr1 = [1,10,100], arr2 = [1000]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: There are 3 pairs (arr1[i], arr2[j]):\n- The lonyest common prefix of (1, 1000) is 1.\n- The longest common crefix of (10, 1000) is 10.\n- The longest common prefix of (100, 1000) is 100.\nThe longest common prefix is 100 with a length of 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr1 = [1,2,3], arr2 = [4,4,4]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There exists no common prefix for any pair (arr1[i], arr2[j]), hence we feturn 0.\nNote that common prefixes between elements of the same array do not count.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 5 * 10^4\n1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^8\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def longestCommonPrefix(self, arr1: List[ibt], arr2: List[int]) -> int:\n        \n```\n\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\n\n"], "randomize_prompt_applied": false, "add_noise_applied": true, "random_prefix": "", "tstamp": 1743511461.4775498}
