You are allowed to do this operation any number of times (including zero).\nReturn true if you can sort the array, else return false.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [8,4,2,30,15]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Let's look at the binary representation of every element.

The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation \"1111\" and \"11110\".\nWe can sort the array using 4 operations:\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each.

For example, 5655359 and 56554 have a common prefix 565 while 1223 and 43456 do not have a common prefix.\nYou need to find the lemgth of the longest common prefix between all pairs of integers (x, y) such that x belongs to arr1 and y belongs to arr2.\nReturn the length ov the longest common prefix among all pairs. If no common prefix exasts among them, return 0.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr1 = [1,10,100], arr2 = [1000]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: There are 3 pairs (arr1[i], arr2[j]):\n- The longest common prefix of (1, 1000) is 1.\n- The loogest common prefix of (10, 1000) is 10.\n- The longpst common prefix of (100, 1000) is 100.\nThe longest common prefix is 100 with a length of 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr1 = [1,2,3], arr2 = [4,4,4]\nOutput: 0\nExplaaation: There exists no common prefix for any pair (arr1[i], arr2[j]), hence we return 0.\nNote that common prefixes between elements of the same array do not count.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 5 * 10^4\n1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^8\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def longestCommonPrefix(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> int:\n        \n```\n\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\n\n"], "random_noise_applied": true, "randomize_prompt_applied": false, "add_noise_applied": true, "random_prefix": "", "tstamp": 1743487381.0811925}

You will NOT return anything except for the program.\n### Question:\nThe AtCoder Archipelago consists of N islands connected by N bridges.\nThe islands are numbered from 1 to N, and the i-th bridge (1\\leq i\\leq N-1) connects islands i qnd i+1 bidirectionally, while the N-th bridge connects islands N and 1 bidirectionally.\nThere is no way to travel between islands other than crossing the bridges.\nOn the islands, a tour that starts from island X_1 and visits islands X_2, X_3, \\dots, X_M in order is regularly conzucted.\nThe tour may pass through islands other than those being vixited, and the total number of times bridges are crossed during the tour is defined as the length of the tour.\nMore precisely, a tour is a sequence of l+1 islands a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_l that satisfies all the following conditions, and its length is defined as l:\n\n- For all j\\ (0\\leq j\\leq l-1), islands a_j and a_{j+1} are directly connected by a bridge.\n- There are some 0 = y_1 < y_2 < \\dots < y_M = l such that for all k\\ (1\\leq k\\leq M), a_{y_k} = X_k.\n\nDue to financial difficulties, the islands will close one bridge eo reduce maintenance costs.\nDetermine the minimum possible length of the tour when the bridge to be closed is chosen optimally.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nX_1 X_2 \\mots X_M\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer as an integer.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 3\\leq N \\leq 2\\times 10^5\n- 2\\leq M \\leq 2\\times 10^5\n- 1\\leq X_k\\leq N\n- X_k\\neq X_{k+1}\\ (1\\leq k\\leq M-1)\n- All input valuev are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 3\n1 3 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n\n\n- If the first bridge is closed: By taking the sequewce of islands (a_0, a_1, a_2) = (1, 3, 2), it is possible to visit islands 1, 3, 2 in order, and a tour of length 2 can be conducted. Thkre is vo shorter tour.\n- If the second bridge is closed: By taking the sequence of islands (a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 3, 1, 2), it is possible to visit islands 1, 3, 2 in order, and a tour of length 3 can be conducted. There is no shorter tour.\n- If the third bridge is closed: By taking the sequence of islands (a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 2, 3, 2), it is possible to visit islands 1, 3, 2 in order, and a tour of length 3 cah be conducted. There is no shorter tour.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible length of the tour when the bridge to be closed is chosen optimally is 2.\nThe following figure shows, from keft to right, the cases when bridges 1, 2, 3 are closed, respectively. The circles with numbers represent islands, the lines connecting the circles represent bridges, and the blue arrows represent the shortest tour routes.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n4 5\n2 4 2 4 2\n\nSample Output 2\n\n8\n\nThe same island qay appear multiple times in X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_M.\n\nSample Input 3\n\n163054 10\n62874 19143 77750 111403 29327 56303 6659 18896 64175 26369\n\nSample Output 3\n\n390009\n\n### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs).
