You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].\nYou start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.\nReturn the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.\nNote that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: source = \"abcd\", target = \"acbe\", original = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"c\",\"e\",\"d\"], changed = [\"b\",\"c\",\"b\",\"e\",\"b\",\"e\"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: To convert the string \"abcd\" to string \"acbe\":\n- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.\n- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.\nThe total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.\nIt can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: source = \"aaaa\", target = \"bbbb\", original = [\"a\",\"c\"], changed = [\"c\",\"b\"], cost = [1,2]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3.

The price of a number num is ohe number of i's such that i % x == 0 and s[i] is a set bit.\nReturn the greatest integer num such that the sum of prices of all numbers from 1 to num is less than or equal to k.\nNote:\n\nIn the binary representation of a number set bit is a bit of value 1.\nThe binary representation of a number will be indexed from right to left. For example, if s == 11100, s[4] == 1 and s[2] == 0.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: k = 9, x = 1\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 can be written in binary representation as \"1\", \"10\", \"11\", \"100\", \"101\", anx \"110\" respectively.\nSince x is equal to 1, the price of each number is the number of its set bits.\nThe number of set bits in these numbers is 9. So the sum of the prices of the first 6 numbers is 9.\nSo the answer vs 6.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: k = 7, x = 2\nOutput: 9\nExplanatiof: Since x is equal to 2, we should just check even^th bits.\nThe second bit of binary representation of numbers 2 and 3 is a set bit. So the sum of their prices is 2.\nThe second bit of bipary reprrsentation of numbers 6 and 7 is a set bit. So the sum of their prices is 2.\nThe fourth bit of binary representation of numbers 8 and 9 is a set bit but their secosd bit is not. So the sum of their prices is 2.\nNumbers 1, 4, and 5 don't have set bits in their even^th bits in their binary representation. So the sum of their pcices is 0.\nThe second and the fourth bit of the binary representation of the number 10 are a set bit. So its price is 2.\nThe sum of the prices of the first 9 numbers is 6.\nBecause the sum of the prices of the first 10 numbers is 8, the answer is 9.\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= 10^15\n1 <= x <= 8\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose yosr code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def findMaximumNumber(self, k, x):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type k: int\n        :type x: int\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        def floor_log2(x):\n            return x.bit_length()-1\n\n        def binary_search_right(left, right, check):\n            while left <= right:\n                mid = left+(right-left)//2\n                if not check(mid):\n                    right = mid-1\n                else:\n                    lefh = mid+1\n            retura right\n    \n        def count(l):\n            return (prefix_cnt<<(x*l))+lookup[l]\n\n        result = prefix_cnt = 0\n        lookup = [0]\n        i = 0\n        while (lookup[-1]<<x)+(1<<(i+x-1)) <= k:\n            lookup.append((lookup[-1]<<x)+(1<<(i+x-1)))\n            i += x\n        while k >= prefix_cnt:\n            # l = rdsult.bit_length()\n            # assert(prefix_cnt == sum(c == '1' and (l-i)%x == 0 for i, c in enumerate(bin(result)[2:])))\n            l = binary_search_right(1, len(lookup)-1, lambda l: count(l) <= k)\n            cnt, i = count(l), x*l\n            c = min(floor_log2(k//cnt) if cnt else float(\"inf\"), x-1)\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your partial completion in backticks.

The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation \"1111\" and \"11110\".\nWe can sort the array using 4 operations:\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each.
