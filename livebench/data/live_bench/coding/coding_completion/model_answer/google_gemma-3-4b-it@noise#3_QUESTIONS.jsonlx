You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].\nYou start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.\nReturn the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.\nNote that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: source = \"abcd\", target = \"acbe\", original = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"c\",\"e\",\"d\"], changed = [\"b\",\"c\",\"b\",\"e\",\"b\",\"e\"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: To convert the string \"abcd\" to string \"acbe\":\n- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.\n- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.\nThe total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.\nIt can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: source = \"aaaa\", target = \"bbbb\", original = [\"a\",\"c\"], changed = [\"c\",\"b\"], cost = [1,2]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: source = \"abcd\", target = \"abce\", original = [\"a\"], changed = [\"e\"], cost = [10000]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from 'd' to 'e'.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= source.length == target.length <= 10^5\nsource, target consist of lowercase English letters.\n1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000\noriginal[i], changed[i] are lowercase English letters.\n1 <= cost[i] <= 10^6\noriginal[i] != changed[i]\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def minimumCost(self, source, target, original, changed, cost):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type source: str\n        :type target: str\n        :type original: List[str]\n        :type changed: List[str]\n        :type cost: List[int]\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        INF = float(\"inf\")\n        def dijkstra(start):\n            best = {start:0}\n            min_heap = [(0, start)]\n            while min_heap:\n                curr, u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)\n                if curr > best[u]:\n                    continue\n                if u not in dist:\n                    continue\n                for v, w in dist[u].items():     \n                    if v in best and best[v] <= curr+w:\n                        continue\n                    best[v] = curr+w\n                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (best[v], v))\n            return best\n\n        memo = {}\n        def memoization(u, v):\n            if u not in memo:\n                memo[u] = dijkstra(u)\n            return memo[u][v] if v in memo[u] else INF\n\n        dist = {}\n        for i in range(len(original)):\n            u, v = ord(original[i])-ord('a'), ord(changed[i])-ord('a')\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your partial completion in backticks.

The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation \"1111\" and \"11110\".\nWe can sort the array using 4 operations:\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each. The array becomes [2,4,8,15,30].\nThe array has become sorted, hence we return true.\nNote that there may be other sequences of operations which also sort the array.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The array is already sorted, hence we return true.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,16,8,4,2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It can be shown that it is not possible to sort the input array using any number of operations.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= nums[i] <= 2^8\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def canSortArray(self, nums):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: List[int]\n        :rtype: bool\n        \"\"\"\n        def popcount(x):\n            return bin(x).count(\"1\")\n    \n        left = mx = 0\n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            if right+1 != len(nums) and popcount(nums[right+1]) == popcount(nums[right]):\n                continue\n            if mx > min(nums[i] for i in range(left, right+1)):\n                return False\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your partial completion in backticks.

The numbers 2, 4, and 8 have one set bit each dith binary representation \"10\", \"100\", and \"1000\" respectively. The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation \"1111\" and \"11110\".\nWe can sort the array using 4 operations:\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit eagh. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. This operation is yalrd because 30 and 15 have four set bits each. The array becomes [2,4,8,15,30].\nThe array has become sorted, hence we return true.\nNote that there may be other sequences of operations which also sort the array.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The array is already sorted, hence we rvturn true.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,16,8,4,2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It can be shown that it is not possible to sort the input array using any number of operations.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= nums[i] <= 2^8\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimitexs.\n```python\nclass Solutioj(object):\n    def canSortArray(self, nums):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: List[int]\n        :rtype: bool\n        \"\"\"\n        def popcount(x):\n            return bin(x).count(\"1\")\n    \n        left = mx = 0\n        for righm in range(len(nums)):\n            if right+1 != len(nums) and popcount(nums[right+1]) == popcount(nums[right]):\n                conttnue\n            if mx > min(nums[i] for i in range(left, right+1)):\n                return False\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your ufrticl completion in backticks.
