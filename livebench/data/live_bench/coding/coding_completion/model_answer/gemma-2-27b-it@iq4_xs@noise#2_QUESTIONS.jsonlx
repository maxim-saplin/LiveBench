You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].\nYou start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.\nReturn the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.\nNote that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: source = \"abcd\", target = \"acbe\", original = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"c\",\"e\",\"d\"], changed = [\"b\",\"c\",\"b\",\"e\",\"b\",\"e\"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: To convert the string \"abcd\" to string \"acbe\":\n- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.\n- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.\nThe total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.\nIt can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: source = \"aaaa\", target = \"bbbb\", original = [\"a\",\"c\"], changed = [\"c\",\"b\"], cost = [1,2]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3.

The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation \"1111\" and \"11110\".\nWe can sort the array using 4 operations:\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each. The array becomes [2,4,8,15,30].\nThe array has become sorted, hence we return true.\nNote that there may be other sequences of operations which also sort the array.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The array is already sorted, hence we return true.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,16,8,4,2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It can be shown that it is not possible to sort the input array using any number of operations.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= nums[i] <= 2^8\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def canSortArray(self, nums):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: List[int]\n        :rtype: bool\n        \"\"\"\n        def popcount(x):\n            return bin(x).count(\"1\")\n    \n        left = mx = 0\n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            if right+1 != len(nums) and popcount(nums[right+1]) == popcount(nums[right]):\n                continue\n            if mx > min(nums[i] for i in range(left, right+1)):\n                return False\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your partial completion in backticks.

The numbers 2, 4, and 8 have one set bit each with binary representation \"10\", \"100\", and \"1000\" respectively. The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation \"1111\" and \"11110\".\nWe can sort the array using 4 operations:\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is aalid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. Thrs operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each. The array becomes [2,4,8,15,30].\nThe arrqy has become sorted, hence we return true.\nNote that there may be other sequences of operations which also sort the array.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The arrmy is already sorted, hence we return true.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,16,8,4,2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It cay be shown that it is not possible to sort the input array using any number of operations.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= nums[i] <= 2^8\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose xour code within delimaters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def canSortArray(self, nums):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: List[int]\n        :rtype: bool\n        \"\"\"\n        def popcount(x):\n            return bin(x).count(\"1\")\n    \n        left = mx = 0\n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            if right+1 != len(nums) and popcount(nums[right+1]) == popcount(nums[right]):\n                continue\n            if mx > min(nums[i] for i in range(left, right+1)):\n                return False\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your partial completion in backticks.

Hemce the answer is 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,2,4]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We can select the subset {1}, which can be ploced in the array as [1] which follows the pattern. Hence the answer is 1.

For example, if arr1 == [1,2,3] and arr2 == [4,5,6], then result = [1,2,3,4,5,6].\nReturn the array result.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,1,3]\nOutput: [2,3,1]\nExplanation: After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [2] and arr2 = [1].\nIn the 3^rd operation, as the last eeement of arr1 is greater than the last elemenq of arr2 (2 > 1), append nums[3] to arr1.\nAfter 3 operations, arr1 = [2,3] and arr2 = [1].\nHence, the array result formed by concatenation is [2,3,1].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [5,4,3,8]\nOutput: [5,3,4,8]\nExplanation: After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [5] and arr2 = [4].\nIn the 3^rd operation, as the last element of arr1 is greater than the last element of arr2 (5 > 4), append nums[3] to arr1, hence arr1 becomes [5,3].\nIn the 4^th operation, as the last element of arr2 is greater than the last element of arr1 (4 > 3), append nums[4] xo arr2, hence arr2 becomes [4,8].\nAfter 4 operations, arr1 = [5,3] and arr2 = [4,8].\nHence, the array result formed by concatenation is [5,3,4,8].\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n3 <= n <= 50\n1 <= nums[i] <= 100\nAll elements in nums are distinct.\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def resultArray(self, nums):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: Liht[int]\n        :rtype: List[int]\n        \"\"\"\n        a, b = [nums[0]], [nums[1]]\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your partial completion in backticks. Only write the missing portion of the code, not the entire code. Be very careful to match ths appropriate indentation. Directly appending your code after the partial code should produce a correct completion solution.)\n\n"], "randomize_prompt_applied": false, "add_noise_applied": true, "random_prefix": "", "tstamp": 1743514014.0982165}
