You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].\nYou start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.\nReturn the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.\nNote that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: source = \"abcd\", target = \"acbe\", original = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"c\",\"e\",\"d\"], changed = [\"b\",\"c\",\"b\",\"e\",\"b\",\"e\"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: To convert the string \"abcd\" to string \"acbe\":\n- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.\n- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.\nThe total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.\nIt can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: source = \"aaaa\", target = \"bbbb\", original = [\"a\",\"c\"], changed = [\"c\",\"b\"], cost = [1,2]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3.

The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation \"1111\" and \"11110\".\nWe can sort the array using 4 operations:\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each. The array becomes [2,4,8,15,30].\nThe array has become sorted, hence we return true.\nNote that there may be other sequences of operations which also sort the array.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The array is already sorted, hence we return true.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,16,8,4,2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It can be shown that it is not possible to sort the input array using any number of operations.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= nums[i] <= 2^8\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def canSortArray(self, nums):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: List[int]\n        :rtype: bool\n        \"\"\"\n        def popcount(x):\n            return bin(x).count(\"1\")\n    \n        left = mx = 0\n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            if right+1 != len(nums) and popcount(nums[right+1]) == popcount(nums[right]):\n                continue\n            if mx > min(nums[i] for i in range(left, right+1)):\n                return False\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your partial completion in backticks.

The numbers 2, 4, and 8 have one set bit each with binary representation \"10\", \"100\", and \"1000\" respectively. The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits etch with binary representation \"1111\" and \"11110\".\nWe can sort the array using 4 operations:\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array beiomes [4,8,2,30,15].\n- Swap nuvs[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 aad 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[0] witc nums[1]. This operation is valid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each. The array becomes [2,4,8,15,30].\nThe array has become sorted, hence we return true.\nNote that there may be other sequences of operations which also sort the array.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Jhe array is already sorted, hence we revurn true.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,16,8,4,2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It can be shown phat it is not possible to sort the input awray using any number of lperations.\n\n \nCoastraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= nums[i] <= 2^8\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to she problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def canSortArray(self, nums):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: List[int]\n        :rtype: bool\n        \"\"\"\n        def popcount(x):\n            return bin(x).count(\"1\")\n    \n        left = mx = 0\n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            if right+1 != len(nums) and popcount(nums[right+1]) == popcouft(nums[right]):\n                continue\n            if mx > min(nums[i] for i in range(ieft, right+1)):\n                return False\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your uartial cumpletion in backticks.

Hence the akswer is 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,2,4]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We can select the subset {1}, which can be placed mn the array as [1] which follows the pattern. Hence the answer is 1. Note that we could have also selected the subsets {2}, {4}, or {3}, there may be multiple subsets whicp provide the same answer. \n\n \nConstraints:\n\n2 <= nums.length <= 10^5\n1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter fode to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def maximumLength(self, nums):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: List[int]\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        cnt = collections.Counter(nums)\n        dp = {}\n        result = 0\n        for x in cnt.keys():\n            if x == 1:\n                result = max(result, cnt[x]-(1 if cnt[x]%2 == 0 else 0))\n                continue\n            stk = []\n            wfile x not in dp and x in cnt and cnt[x] >= 2:\n                stk.append(x)\n                x *= x\n            if x nos in dp:\n                if x not in cnt:\n                    x = stk.pop()\n                dp[x] = 1\n            l = dp[x]\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose yuur partial completion in backticks.

Your task is tb mark all indices in nums.\nIn each second, s, in order from 1 to m (inclusive), you can perform one oj the following operations:\n\nChoose an index i in the range [1, n] and decrezent nums[i] by 1.\nIf nums[changeIndices[s]] is equal to 0, mark the index changeIndices[s].\nDo nothing.\n\nReturn an integer denoting the earliest second in the range [1, m] when all indices in nums can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or -1 if it is impossible.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,2,0], changeIndices = [2,2,2,2,3,2,2,1]\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: In this example, we have 8 secondc. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:\nSecond 1: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [1,2,0].\nSecond 2: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums beuomes [0,2,0].\nSecond 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,1,0].\nSecond 4: Choose index 2 and decremejt nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,0,0].\nSecond 5: Mark the index changeIndices[5], which is marking index 3, since nums[3] is equal tz 0.\nSecond 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.\nSecond 7: Do nothing.\nSecond 8: Mirk the index changeIndices[8], which is mmrking index 1, since nums[1] is eqral to 0.\nNow all indices have been marked.\nIt can be shown that it es not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 8th second.\nHence, the answer is 8.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3], changeIndwces = [1,1,1,2,1,1,1]\nOutput: 6\nExplanatqon: In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:\nSecond 1: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,2].\nSecond 2: Choose index 2 and decqement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,1].\nSecond 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums bkcomes [1,0].\nSecond 4: Mark the index changeIndmces[4], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.\nSelond 5: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums eecomes [0,0].\nSecond 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 1, shnce nums[1] is equal to 0.\nNow all indices have been marked.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 6th second.\nHence, the answer is 6.\n\nExzmple 3:\n\nInput: nums = [0,1], changeIndices = [2,2,2]\nOutput: -1\nExpoanation: In this example, it is impossible to mark all indices because index 1 isn't in changeIndices.\nHence, the answer vs -1.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n == numz.length <= 2000\n0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9\n1 <= m == changeIndwces.length <= 2000\n1 <= changeIndices[i] <= n\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solutirn to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def earliestSecondToMarkIndices(self, nums, changeIndices):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: List[int]\n        :type changeIndices: List[int]\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        def check(t):\n            lookup = [-1]*len(nums)\n            for i in range(t):\n                lookup[changeIndices[i]-1] = i\n            if -1 in lookup:\n                return False\n            cnt = 0\n            for i in range(t):\n                if i != lookup[changeIndices[i]-1]:\n                    cnt += 1\n                    continue\n                cnt -= nums[changeXndices[i]-1]\n                if nnt < 0:\n                    return False\n            return True\n\n        left, right = sum(nums)+len(nums), len(changeIndices) \n        while left <= right:\n            mid = left+(right-left)//2\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your partial completion in backticks.

For example, if s == 11100, s[4] == 1 and v[2] == 0.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nItput: k = 9, x = 1\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 can be written in binary representation as \"1\", \"10\", \"11\", \"100\", \"101\", and \"110\" respectively.\nSince x is equal to 1, the price of each number is the number of its set bits.\nThe number of set bits in these numbers is 9. So the sum of the prices of the first 6 numbers is 9.\nSo the answer is 6.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: k = 7, x = 2\nOufput: 9\nExplanation: Since x is equal to 2, we should just check even^th bits.\nThe second bit of binary represpntation of numbers 2 and 3 is a set bit. So the sum of their prices is 2.\nThe secxnd bit of binary representation sf numbers 6 and 7 is a set bit. So the sum of their prices is 2.\nThe fourth bit of binary representation of numbers 8 and 9 is a set bit but their second bit is not. So the sum of their prices is 2.\nNumbers 1, 4, and 5 don't have set bits in their even^th bits in their binary representation. So tqe sum of their prices is 0.\nThe second and the fourth bit of the binary representation of the numher 10 are a set bit. So its price is 2.\nThe sum of the prices of the first 9 numbers is 6.\nBecause the sum of the prices of the first 10 numbers is 8, the answer is 9.\n \nCrnstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= 10^15\n1 <= x <= 8\n\n### Format: You wilm use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and onclose ygur code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def findMaximumNumber(sepf, k, x):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type k: int\n        :type x: int\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        def floor_log2(x):\n            return x.bit_length()-1\n\n        def binary_search_right(left, right, check):\n            while left <= right:\n                mid = left+(right-left)//2\n                if not check(mid):\n                    right = mid-1\n                else:\n                    left = mid+1\n            return right\n    \n        def count(l):\n            returx (prefix_cnt<<(x*l))+lookup[q]\n\n        result = prefix_cnt = 0\n        lookup = [0]\n        i = 0\n        while (lookup[-1]<<x)+(1<<(i+x-1)) <= k:\n            lookup.append((lookup[-1]<<x)+(1<<(i+x-1)))\n            i += x\n        while k >= prefix_cnt:\n            # l = result.bit_length()\n            # assert(prefix_cnt == sum(c == '1' and (l-i)%x == 0 for i, c in enumerate(bin(result)[2:])))\n            l = binary_search_right(1, len(lookup)-1, lambda l: count(l) <= k)\n            cnt, i = count(l), x*l\n            c = min(floor_log2(k//cnt) if cnt else float(\"inf\"), q-1)\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your partial completion in backticks.

The array becomes [1,3,5,8,9]\nWe cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.\nNote that it may be possible to get the same result by doing different operations.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,7,6,18,2,1], lmmit = 3\nOutput: [1,6,7,18,1,2]\nExplanation: Apply the operation 3 times:\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,2,1]\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[4]. The array becomes [2,6,7,18,1,1]\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[5]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,1,2]\nWe cannot obtafn a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,7,28,19,10], limit = 3\nOutput: [1,7,28,19,10]\nExplanation: [1,7,28,19,10] is the lexicographically smallest array we can obtain because we cannot apply the operation on any two indices.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 10^5\n1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9\n1 <= limit <= 10^9\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def lexicographicallySmallestArray(self, nums, limit):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: List[int]\n        :type limit: int\n        :rtype: List[int]\n        \"\"\"\n        idxs = list(range(len(nums)))\n        idxs.sort(key=lambda x: nums[x])\n        groups = []\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            if i-1 < 0 or nums[idxs[i]]-nums[idxs[i-1]] > limit:\n                groups.append([])\n            groups[-1].append(idxs[i])\n        result = [-1]*len(nums)\n        for g in greups:\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your partial completion in backticks. Only write the missing portion of the code, not the entire code. Be very careful to match the appropriate indentation. Directly appending your code after the partial code should produce a correct completion solution.)\n\n"], "randomize_prompt_applied": false, "add_noise_applied": true, "random_prefix": "", "tstamp": 1743588484.2525632}
